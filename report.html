Introduction:
I made the decision to establish a website that resembled an online platform for food articles and blogs, which provides up-to-the-minute culinary updates, restaurant evaluations, and displays images of delectable delicacies. The webpages themselves incorporate diverse arrangements including grids fashioned out from blocks displaying pictures or text fields, carousels highlighting several pieces unified in one section enabling readers to seamlessly sift through them all at once as well as video integration depicting captivating material such as cooking demos or eatery appraisals. This variation makes it effortless for people perusing the pages on my site find what they're searching for while giving designers leeway when creating content within different specifications depending upon how their message will best be conveyed.

Accessibility:
I have added alternative text to images to accommodate the visual impaired so that their Screen Reader software will still be able to describe the image to them.
Another aspect of accessibility that i have added to my site is by Using HTML elements that convey the meaning of the content, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer>, instead of relying on visual cues.
I have also added a color contrast for any text over images to make it accessible to people with visual impairments.

Usability:
I Kept the design and navigation of the website simple and intuitive, avoiding clutter and unnecessary complexity for ease of navigation.
I also used consistent design and navigation elements throughout the website, as this helps users to feel more comfortable and confident when using the site.
I also provide clear feedback to users when they take an action, such as hovering over the buttons on the carousel, to let them know that the action has been successful.

Learning:
State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?

I have learnt that it is very difficult to find specific pictures that are open sourced, itll be easier if you are able to take the photo yourself. especially when youre trying to feature current events such as the artbox article, where i am unable to find open source content to display the dishes that they were selling at the event. In the end i just use an open source website for pictures called https://unsplash.com/, and sourced for the most similar picture. 


I have also learnt that google is your best friend when it comes to coding as you can learn from people who have faced similar issues before me. The problem is integrating the solutions or methods that they code into my own code. Not every code found online can be copied and pasted into my own code without anybugs. Another skill i learn is troubleshooting. Without being able to troubleshoot, i will never be able to incorporate any of the codes found online. 

Evaluation I:
What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?
I think even though i was able to find templates online, such as the bootstrap templates for carousel, simply copying and pasting into my code didnt work initially. I had to trouble shoot and figure out why things werent working. After i managed to get it to work, i still had to tweak the code to fit my website. 

Evaluation II:
What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another
Time?

Upon reflection, I realize that I may have missed out on a valuable opportunity to utilize Javascript more effectively in my website for this assignment. I believe that incorporating more animated elements with Javascript could have significantly enhanced the interactivity and engagement of users. Moving forward, I will make a conscious effort to explore the capabilities of Javascript further to create an even more immersive user experience.

Furthermore, as I look back at my work, I recognize that there is room for improvement in terms of the organization and structure of my code. While my code may function properly, it is important to ensure that it is written in a clear and concise manner so that others can easily understand it. By taking the time to write more organized code, I can not only improve the overall quality of my work but also make it easier for others to follow and collaborate on in the future.
