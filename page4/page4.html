                <p class="fs-6">Good news for Artbox fans: the popular Thai food and lifestyle fair is returning to Singapore after a three-year break! Artbox Singapore, titled ARTBOX VISION 2023, is set to happen from 24 to 26 February, and 3 to 5 March 2023, from 12pm to 11pm daily. Boasting almost 300 booths, including famous food kiosks from Thailand, the two-weekend-long fair will take place at Singapore Expo Hall 6.</p>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/image.jpg" alt="store front" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">We’ve curated the 8 best food to try at Artbox Singapore 2023, so consider this your go-to guide if you’re heading down!</p>
                <hr><h1>1. Tandoori Chicken Burgers</h1><hr>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/arabi-ishaque-vAAJI5sg9j4-unsplash.jpg" alt="tandoori burger!" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">For some lip-smackingly good burgers and fries, check out Mahmud’s Tandoor, an online business that’s making an appearance at Artbox this year. The Muslim-owned stall made waves when they were scored Best Burger at the Halal Awards in 2020, held by the online food site Halalfoodhunt.</p>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/brad-acx4iJr0mGA-unsplash.jpg" alt="chees fries" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">Tuck into their famous Crispy Doori AKA tandoori chicken burgers, priced at $10 each and $12 with fries. You can also opt to upgrade to loaded masala fries as we did, which will bring your total to $15. You get a sizeable sandwich with a whole chunk of well-seasoned tandoori chicken thigh, tucked between toasted buns. It’s accompanied by a side of fries tossed in an aromatic masala seasoning, topped with cheese and a creamy dressing. Yum.</p>

                <hr><h1>2. Hotpot in a Cup</h1><hr>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/avnish-rathore-QFNGSSSoGUo-unsplash.jpg" alt="hot pot in a cup !" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">No Time Hot Pot is a popular food delivery service HomelyPot‘s latest venture. Here you can get mobile hotpot served in a cute cup, loaded with steamboat ingredients and a delicious broth. Dive straight into the aptly named No Time Anyhow ($16.80), which features toppings such as Prawn Paste with Fish Roe, Oozing Cheese Tofu, and Handmade Pork Ball.</p>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/markus-winkler-57EDibTULBw-unsplash.jpg" alt="noodles" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">You also get to choose from two soups: No Time Ma La and No Time Ketchup, which is a tangy tomato-based broth. Each serving comes with instant noodles, and is great for sharing among two.</p>
                <a class="fs-6 article-text nav-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/notime.sg/">Website</a>
                <hr><h1>3. Loaded Bagels </h1><hr>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/christian-kaindl-XOv2hyvyLmE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Loaded Bagels!" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">If you’re a fan of Whiskdom, you’ll be happy to spot their kiosk at Artbox Singapore 2023. Besides their cult favourite lava brownies and cookies, you’ll also find their new range of bagel sandwiches, starring house-made bagels.</p>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/douglas-bagg-ekS_3hYxpXM-unsplash.jpg" alt="Loaded Bagels" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">We recommend the Truffle Beef Steak Bagel ($13.90): juicy beef slices and caramelised onions tucked between soft and chewy bagels. Other crowd favourites include the Mentaiko Chick Bagel ($12.90), as well as the all-new Beef Tots ($8.90): tater tots topped with a generous portion of beef slices, drizzled with a truckload of cheese sauce.</p>

                <hr><h1>4. Fried Cheesy Mochi</h1><hr>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/matt-ketchum-Qtka_IpkMow-unsplash.jpg" alt="people making mochi" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">New kid on the block At Dawn is making their pop-up debut at Artbox this year! Here you’ll find innovative Japanese fusion bites such as the Fried Cheese Mochi ($8 for three), an addictive snack comprising a sweet and savoury mochi centre, lightly breaded and deep-fried for the perfect crust and IG-worthy cheese pull.</p>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/seiya-maeda-8jGsEm4_GuI-unsplash.jpg" alt="mochi!" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">You can also fill up on the Transforming Buta Don ($6.50), which sees creamy scrambled eggs atop a bed of pearl rice, finished off with a unique jelly sauce.</p>
                <a class="fs-6 article-text nav-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/atdawn.sg/">Website</a>
                <hr><h1>5. Wagyu Onigiri</h1><hr>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/samia-liamani-MURbkTcUdCA-unsplash.jpg" alt="Onigiri" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">Fans of Rappu, heads up: the sushi restaurant is rolling out an exclusive menu of onigiri, only for this festival! Try the Wagyu Onigiri ($8), made with shoyu Wagyu, roasted green chilli, spring onion, and toasted nori. Seafood lovers can also get the Prawn Onigiri ($6), which comes with sakura ebi and prawn head mayo, or the Crab Jumeokbap ($7), a Korean-inspired rice ball with crab lump meat and pickled radish. Otherwise, get the Onigiri Trio ($18) to try them all!</p>

                <hr><h1>6. Kakigori </h1><hr>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/hiroshi-tsubono-nIdgiEZTqSQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="Kakigori also known as shaved ice" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">Cool down from the heat with a refreshing Raspberry Kakigori ($9) from Smooze, which specialises in dairy-free and vegan-friendly desserts. This icy treat-in-a-bowl comes with shaved coconut ice, topped with sweet potato powder and a raspberry popsicle. It’s sweet and earthy, with a tangy fruitness from the berry—the perfect treat on a hot day! Other popular kakigori flavours include Strawberry ($9) and Calamansi ($8.50), the latter of which comes with sour plum powder and chilli flakes.</p>
                <a class="fs-6 article-text nav-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/smooze.fun/?hl=en">Website</a>
                <hr><h1>7. Black Garlic Ramen </h1><hr>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/diego-lozano-mE6kjov4rTg-unsplash.jpg" alt="Ramen" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">Homegrown hawker stall Ramen Shiba garnered some attention from Westsiders after launching at West Coast Plaza six months ago. They’ve also set up shop at Artbox 2023! We highly recommend the Black Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen ($12): springy noodles packed with thick slices of chashu, topped with a hanjuku egg. The broth is the star here; it’s creamy, robust, and full-on flavour.</p>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/huyen-bui-NHEL1M1Cv-A-unsplash.jpg" alt="Ramen" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">For a more unadulterated taste of their signature pork bone broth, order the Original Tonkotsu Ramen ($11) instead</p>
                <a class="fs-6 article-text nav-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/ramenshibasg/?hl=en">Website</a>
                <hr><h1>8. Juicy Sliders</h1><hr>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/lindsey-elsey-Lj-LZvOqyiQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="Sliders" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">OOTB AKA Out of the Bun is an underrated burger joint in GR.ID Mall. At the food fair, you can get a taste of their signature sliders, ideal if you’re not up for a full meal. The Slider + Tater Tots combo is priced at $11.90 and comes with one mini burger plus a pile of tater tots on the side.</p>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/aleisha-kalina-XVtL4oRMhdY-unsplash.jpg" alt="Sliders" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">The Classic Cheese slider is a must-try; it comes with a juicy Black Angus beef patty, fresh veggies, cheddar, caramelised onions, and dill pickles, between two fluffy buns. Those who prefer chicken can opt for the Pulled Chick instead, as it comes with slow-cooked chicken, paired with a refreshing slaw.</p>
                <a class="fs-6 article-text nav-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/ootbsg/?hl=en">Website</a>
                <hr><h1>Best Artbox Singapore 2023 food</h1><hr>
                <img src="../page4/page4 img/anshu-a-WUFiJ6BoQhQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="noodles" class="img-fluid">
                <p class="fs-6">There are plenty more food stalls to check out at Artbox 2023, including famous names from Thailand! Try Michelin Bib Gourmand stall Tang Jai Yang, known for their Cantonese-style char siew, as well as Khanom Babin Maphrao On Gusto, which offers coconut pancakes.
